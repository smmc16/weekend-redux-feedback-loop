# Project Name

Weekend Redux Feedback Loop

## Description

I made a website that takes in feedback and posts the feedback to a database. I made this using react and redux to keep track of the results as they are entered before posting to the database. 

## Installation

1. Create a database called "prime_feedback".
2. Enter the queries in the database.sql file.
3. Run 'npm install' in the terminal.
4. Run 'npm run server' in the terminal.
5. Run 'npm run client' in the terminal.

## Usage

1. Enter feedback into the inputs.
2. Click submit to go the next page.
3. Continue entering feedback until the review page.
4. Submit your feedback on the review page to post to the database.
5. After submitting feedback click the button to enter more feedback to start over. 

## Built With
